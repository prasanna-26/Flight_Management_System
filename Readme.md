# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Management System

## üìå Introduction

The **Flight Management System** is a mobile-friendly application designed to streamline flight-related tasks for passengers. Users can:

- Easily **book**, **modify**, or **cancel** flights  
- Complete **web check-ins** and obtain **boarding passes** from home  
- Receive timely **notifications** about upcoming flights and tasks  
- Track baggage in **real-time** using the **"Baggage Track"** feature

Each bag is tagged with a unique barcode during airport check-in, enabling passengers to monitor its status and ensure it's en route to the correct destination‚Äîsimilar to a delivery tracking app. Currently, the system supports flight information from a single airline (e.g., Emirates).
